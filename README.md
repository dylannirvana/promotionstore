# Promotion Store

This development project serves as a template builder for Promotion Store and its affiliates.

## Methodology

Modern Front End "Single Page Applications" like this are built with top-tier web properties like Facebook and Instagram in mind. They perform better, are faster and relatively real-time, and conform to contemporary User Experience standards. They are Responsive and are built for mobile. This should be borne out in metrics on Google Analytics.

If your customers experiences are easy and enjoyable, you sell more stuff.

There are two parts to this type of application. The first is the Front End or client-side application. This is HTML5 CSS3 JavaScript built with an advanced workflow using Gulp.js as a task runner. This automates the build process and manages dependencies, which greatly speeds development. The Front End app is completely ecumenical to the Back End; it can work with almost any server-side configuration.

The second part is server and its database. In this particular situation, we will be dropping this Front End application onto an instance of WordPress. From there I will build a custom theme based on Underscores in PHP MySQL to receive it. WordPress will provide a Content Management System, an ecosystem of prebuilt plugins, and e-commerce through Woo Commerce.

(There is a more advanced configuration that uses Node.js on the Back End via Meteor.js, and React and Angular on the Front End).

In either case, the application(s) are extensible and built to scale with the growth of the business. Also, because they are using accepted standards and best practices, it will not be difficult for other developers to continue development or make adjustments.

You will be able to add modules that will automatically conform to the design. Features like blogs, pretty much unlimited pages and other plugins can be added without a whole lot of configuration. Equally, you can use these templates to build an unlimited number of other stand-alone sites.
